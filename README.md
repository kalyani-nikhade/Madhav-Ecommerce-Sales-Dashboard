# Madhav-Ecommerce-Sales-Dashboard
Here are detailed insights from the Madhav Ecommerce Sales Dashboard in pointers:

Kerala is the top-performing state by revenue: Kerala leads all states in total sales amount, clearly outperforming other regions like Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, and Gujarat. This suggests a strong market presence and high customer engagement in Kerala compared to other states.

Printers and Sarees are the leading product categories: Both categories have achieved the highest sales figures (59K each), indicating a balanced high demand for both electronic goods and traditional apparel. Bookcases, Phones, and Electronic Games follow, with sales gradually decreasing, highlighting the diverse nature of customer purchases.

Customer spending is concentrated among a few top buyers: The top customers, namely Hariwansh and Madhav, contribute significantly to sales, each spending notably more than the next tier of customers. This indicates a reliance on repeat or high-value buyers, which is a potential area to leverage for loyalty programs.

COD is the most preferred payment mode: Cash on Delivery accounts for more than one-third of all transactions (35.45%), reflecting that a significant portion of customers still prefer paying after receiving the product. This may also suggest limited trust in online payment methods or specific regional preferences.

Profit and quantity contributions vary by state: Madhya Pradesh contributes the largest share in terms of profit and quantity, while Maharashtra and UP have a smaller but still substantial share. This shows that while Kerala has the most revenue, other states have notable impacts on overall operational efficiency and profitability.

Stable profit trend with moderate fluctuations: The "Profit by Month" line chart indicates that monthly profit remains relatively stable with moderate fluctuations from Jan 2018 to the end of the year, signaling a well-managed operation with no major downward spells but also no sharp peaks.

High Average Order Value (AOV): With an AOV of 121K, the business sees relatively large baskets per transaction, pointing toward high-value purchases either by individuals or via bulk buying, which can inform marketing and upsell strategies.
